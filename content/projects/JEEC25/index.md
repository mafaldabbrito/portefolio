### JEEC 
*Engineering & Tech Talks*

[JEEC](https://jeec.ist/) translates to **Electrical and Computer Engineering Conferences** and is composed by a group of Instituto Superior Técnico's (IST) students whose main purpose is to organize an event with the intention of **closing the gap between the business world and university life**. This event happens every year in May at IST for the past **25 years**. 

I integrated the **Web Development team** in June of 2024 and since then have been involved in implementing the front end and communication with the back end server for the back office, website, and web application.

### My work

Both the back office and the website's front end was implemented in **[Vue](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction)** - a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.  

This was my first real experience with Web development and although it was not easy in the beginning, starting with Vue was perfect to understand the relationship between **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

The component based architecture is amazing to work with and very easy to create pop ups and other dynamic components. 

In the previews are the parts of the project I was assigned to.
