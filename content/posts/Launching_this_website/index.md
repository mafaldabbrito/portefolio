### The Mighty Portfolio

Welcome to my corner on the internet ! 
My name is Mafalda and I am a Master's student of Networks and Communication Systems at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico, University of Lisbon, Portugal.

To document and share my journey through the fields of Cybersecurity and Networks I created this little portfolio.

In here you will find my small experiments in the [Home Lab]({{< ref "posts" >}}) section and the bigger projects I have been a part of in [Projects]({{< ref "projects" >}})
