My name is Mafalda and I am a Master\u0026rsquo;s student of Networks and Communication Systems at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico, University of Lisbon, Portugal.\nTo document and share my journey through the fields of Cybersecurity and Networks I created this little portfolio.\nIn here you will find my small experiments in the Home Lab section and the bigger projects I have been a part of in Projects.\nDevelopment and Deployment of the Portfolio #So as you may have noticed this website was made with Hugo. Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. It offers a bunch of themes you can choose from this one is an adaptation of the Congo theme.\nSo first I needed to install Go and make sure Git was updated. Then install Hugo and follow the instructions on Congo\u0026rsquo;s theme page to install the specified theme.\nMeanwhile I bought a domain name and transferred it to Hostinger so I could host my website in it. Also added a webhook to the GitHub repo so that every time there are new changes it sends them Hostinger (only the hostinger branch).\nTo simplify the process of adding new articles to the portfolio I adapted a script created by NetworkChuck (The GOAT), that syncs a folder in my Obsidian vault with the content on my website. Not only that but it commits the changes made and pushes them to GitHub (master and hostinger branch). To this script I added the input argument with a personalized commit message and the ability to navigate through directories (needed for synchronizing the images).\nAll the credits go out to NetworkChuck who did a beautiful tutorial on this : I started a blog \u0026hellip;\nThe Idea Behind the Logo #! According to the internet ðŸ¤¡ my name Mafalda means Mighty in battle. So of course I had to get a ==Mighty Warrior== to represent me.\n","date":"11 March 2025","permalink":"/posts/launching_this_website/","section":"Home Lab","summary":"","title":"Launching this website"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/markdown/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Markdown"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/obsidian/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Obsidian"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/","section":"The Mighty Portfolio","summary":"","title":"The Mighty Portfolio"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":" Hacking, learning, and breaking (safely) ðŸ”¥ðŸ’» My home lab is where I experiment with cybersecurity and networking (mostly software).
