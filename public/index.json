My name is Mafalda, and Iâ€™m a Master\u0026rsquo;s student of Networks and Communication Systems at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico, University of Lisbon, Portugal.\nThis portfolio is a document and showcase of my journey through cybersecurity and network technologies â€“ a project Iâ€™ve been working on to document and share my learning experiences.\nHere youâ€™ll find my experiments in the Home Lab section and the larger projects Iâ€™ve been involved in in the Projects.\nDevelopment and Deployment of the Portfolio #I built this website with Hugo, a popular open-source static site generator. Hugo is a great choice, offering a wide range of themes to customize the look and feel. I adapted the [Congo] theme for a starting point, then customized it with a few tweaks.\nFirst, I installed Go and ensured I had the latest version of Git updated. Then, I installed Hugo and followed the instructions on Congoâ€™s theme page to install the specified theme.\nMeanwhile, I secured a domain name and transferred it to Hostinger to host my website. I also added a webhook to the GitHub repo so that every time there are new changes, it automatically sends them to Hostinger â€“ only the hostinger branch.\nTo streamline the process of adding new articles, I adapted a script created by [NetworkChuck](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9x0A[NetworkChuck](https://www.google.com/ul?sa=t\u0026source=web\u0026rct=j\u0026opi=89978449\u0026url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9x0AN7BWHpCDHSm9NiJFJQ\u0026ved=2ahUKEwizqIqa3JSMAxU3IhAIHTmBPdYQFnoECBkQAQ\u0026usg=AOvVaw1SQ5El0uL1lsJ6DCW_W4fJ) (The GOAT), which syncs a folder in my Obsidian vault with the content on my website. This script also commits the changes made and pushes them to GitHub (master and hostinger branches). I added a personalized commit message and the ability to navigate through directories â€“ crucial for synchronizing images.\nThe credits for this project go to NetworkChuck, who created a fantastic tutorial. I started a blog \u0026hellip; The Idea Behind the Logo # According to the internet, my name, Mafalda, means Mighty in battle. So, I wanted to represent that with a warrior figure! There\u0026rsquo;s no better symbol to describe my journey through this course.\n","date":"11 March 2025","permalink":"/posts/launching_this_website/","section":"Home Lab","summary":"","title":"Launching this website"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/markdown/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Markdown"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/obsidian/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Obsidian"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/","section":"The Mighty Portfolio","summary":"","title":"The Mighty Portfolio"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":" Hacking, learning, and breaking (safely) ðŸ”¥ðŸ’» My home lab is where I experiment with cybersecurity and networking (mostly software).
