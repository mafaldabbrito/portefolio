I worked with concepts like V2X communication, network architecture, protocol stacks, and Internet integration.\nWe studied cooperative applications for mobility, their network requirements, and how to support them using event-driven and periodic services. At the transport level, I learned about MANET routing, location-based addressing, IPv6, and Mobile IP, gaining hands-on knowledge of how real-time communication and data flow are managed in dynamic, mobile environments.\nProblem to solve #For the final project we had to solve a mobility problem we found from queering people on the streets around our faculty. We choose bike theft.\nBike theft is a widespread issue in urban areas, discouraging people from using personal mobility devices like bicycles and scooters.\nDespite physical locks, theft remains common and often goes unreported or unresolved, leading to low public trust and reduced adoption of eco-friendly transport.\nExisting solutions lack real-time responsiveness and integration with smart city infrastructure.\nBIKO #Traditional anti-theft measures (locks, GPS trackers) are isolated and ineffective in real time. Urban areas lack decentralized, cooperative systems capable of detecting and responding to theft dynamically. BIKO addresses this by creating a local ad hoc network where devices communicate to monitor, detect, and report suspicious activity collectively.\nKey Technologies \u0026amp; Architecture:\nRSU-OBU Communication (Ad Hoc Network):\nBIKO creates a wireless communication link between On-Board Units (OBUs) on bikes and Road Side Units (RSUs) deployed in bike parking zones. This V2I (Vehicle-to-Infrastructure) setup allows:\nAuthentication via RFID when entering or leaving a monitored zone. Detection of stolen bikes. Low-latency alerts to nearby RSUs in the absence of Internet. OBU (On-Board Unit):\nEmbedded with RFID tag for user authentication and Raspberry pico for V2I communication. Designed to be low-power, small, and easy to deploy. RSU (Road Side Unit):\nRaspberry Pi-based node with RFID reader, camera, and network interface.\nActs as a communication relay, interfacing with both the OBU locally and the centralized web system via Wi-Fi or Ethernet.\nNetwork Protocol Design:\nInitial prototype uses Wi-Fi-based ad hoc communication to establish peer-to-peer discovery between RSUs and OBUs.\nSupports future enhancements using MANET routing, location-based addressing, and V2X stack integration.\nWeb Application \u0026amp; Back-end:\nDeveloped with Python (Flask) for user registration, theft alerts, and data visualization.\nAlerts are pushed in real time to users and admins.\nImportant Links # Web app (Demo version) ","date":"11 March 2025","permalink":"/projects/biko/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"BIKO"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/go/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Go"},{"content":" Hacking, learning, and breaking (safely) üî•üíª My home lab is where I experiment with cybersecurity and networking (mostly software).

My name is Mafalda, and I‚Äôm a Master\u0026rsquo;s student of Networks and Communication Systems at Instituto Superior T√©cnico, University of Lisbon, Portugal.\nThis portfolio is a document and showcase of my journey through cybersecurity and network technologies ‚Äì a project I‚Äôve been working on to document and share my learning experiences.\nHere you‚Äôll find my experiments in the Home Lab section and the larger projects I‚Äôve been involved in in the Projects.\nDevelopment and Deployment of the Portfolio #I built this website with Hugo, a popular open-source static site generator. Hugo is a great choice, offering a wide range of themes to customize the look and feel. I adapted the [Congo] theme for a starting point, then customized it with a few tweaks.\nFirst, I installed Go and ensured I had the latest version of Git updated. Then, I installed Hugo and followed the instructions on Congo‚Äôs theme page to install the specified theme.\nMeanwhile, I secured a domain name and transferred it to Hostinger to host my website. I also added a webhook to the GitHub repo so that every time there are new changes, it automatically sends them to Hostinger ‚Äì only the hostinger branch.\nTo streamline the process of adding new articles, I adapted a script created by NetworkChuck (The GOAT), which syncs a folder in my Obsidian vault with the content on my website. This script also commits the changes made and pushes them to GitHub (master and hostinger branches). I added a personalized commit message and the ability to navigate through directories ‚Äì crucial for synchronizing images.\nThe credits for this project go to NetworkChuck, who created a fantastic tutorial: I started a blog \u0026hellip; The Idea Behind the Logo # According to the internet, my name, Mafalda, means Mighty in battle.

The one thing we could help him with was navigation within the campus.\nAlthough he already had a app for it it only pointed to the place so we challenged ourselves to integrate Google Maps\u0026rsquo; directions in an app that not points (with haptics clues) to the correct direction.\nWe called it Visualize!\nDevelopment and Deployment of the App #Research #In the first part of the semester we did a lot of research on the topic.\nWe had meetings with APEC (Association for Support to Blind Education) who became our partners in this project. With their help we concluded, per example, that our app must have all icons labeled for voice-over functionalities to enable comprehensive audio navigation for both iOS and Android users.\nWe also researched other existing indoor solutions a few of them with open-source software like Osiris, Anyplace, Navigine and Google Maps (API).\nWe decided to go with Google Maps since it was already implemented in our university (all rooms were labeled and divided between floors).\nImplementation #For the design of the app we used Figma. and then transferred it to Flutter. This way we created a simple app compatible with a wide variety of operating systems (Web, IOS, Android).\nI was in charge of integrating the Google Maps\u0026rsquo;s and the haptics clues with the cataloged locations.\nSteps of the Navigation Function\nParses the route provided by the Routes API into multiple segments. Determines the user\u0026rsquo;s current segment using real-time location data. Utilizes the phone\u0026rsquo;s compass to ensure the user is heading towards the beginning of the next segment. Transmits sound and vibration feedback to indicate the correct direction. Repeats the above steps continuously until the user reaches the destination. Sneak Peak into our final presentation Outcome #We‚Äôve found that this system‚Äôs performance is markedly superior outdoors than indoors. Even in Android phones where Google uses Wi-Fi positioning indoor the accuracy is rather low and the routes are very limited.\nOverall it was a great experience to learn how to work with Flutter and how to use Google\u0026rsquo;s API\u0026rsquo;s (namely Routes API).\nIn the Demo Day we were given the award for the best Website (link here), honorable mention for the Prototype and decided by the public second Best Overall Product.\nImportant Links # Web App Website Video ","date":"29 June 2024","permalink":"/projects/pic/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"Bachelor's final project"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/directions/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Directions"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/flutter/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Flutter"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/google/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Google"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/indoor/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Indoor"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/maps/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Maps"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"}]
