My name is Mafalda, and I‚Äôm a Master\u0026rsquo;s student of Networks and Communication Systems at Instituto Superior T√©cnico, University of Lisbon, Portugal.\nThis portfolio is a document and showcase of my journey through cybersecurity and network technologies ‚Äì a project I‚Äôve been working on to document and share my learning experiences.\nHere you‚Äôll find my experiments in the Home Lab section and the larger projects I‚Äôve been involved in in the Projects.\nDevelopment and Deployment of the Portfolio #I built this website with Hugo, a popular open-source static site generator. Hugo is a great choice, offering a wide range of themes to customize the look and feel. I adapted the [Congo] theme for a starting point, then customized it with a few tweaks.\nFirst, I installed Go and ensured I had the latest version of Git updated. Then, I installed Hugo and followed the instructions on Congo‚Äôs theme page to install the specified theme.\nMeanwhile, I secured a domain name and transferred it to Hostinger to host my website. I also added a webhook to the GitHub repo so that every time there are new changes, it automatically sends them to Hostinger ‚Äì only the hostinger branch.\nTo streamline the process of adding new articles, I adapted a script created by NetworkChuck (The GOAT), which syncs a folder in my Obsidian vault with the content on my website. This script also commits the changes made and pushes them to GitHub (master and hostinger branches). I added a personalized commit message and the ability to navigate through directories ‚Äì crucial for synchronizing images.\nThe credits for this project go to NetworkChuck, who created a fantastic tutorial: I started a blog \u0026hellip; The Idea Behind the Logo # According to the internet, my name, Mafalda, means Mighty in battle. So, I wanted to represent that with a warrior figure! There\u0026rsquo;s no better symbol to describe my journey through this course.\n","date":"11 March 2025","permalink":"/posts/launching_this_website/","section":"Home Lab","summary":"","title":"Launching this website"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/markdown/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Markdown"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/obsidian/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Obsidian"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/","section":"The Mighty Portfolio","summary":"","title":"The Mighty Portfolio"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/api/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"API"},{"content":"VISUALIZE #Bridging Vision Gaps in University Spaces\nWe were impacted by a visually impaired colleague at T√©cnico who had to quit his studies due to the lack of accessibility for people like him. The one thing we could help him with was navigation within the campus.\nAlthough he already had a app for it it only pointed to the place so we challenged ourselves to integrate Google Maps\u0026rsquo; directions in an app that not points (with haptics clues) to the correct direction.\nWe called it Visualize!\nDevelopment and Deployment of the App #Research #In the first part of the semester we did a lot of research on the topic.\nWe had meetings with APEC (Association for Support to Blind Education) who became our partners in this project. With their help we concluded, per example, that our app must have all icons labeled for voice-over functionalities to enable comprehensive audio navigation for both iOS and Android users.\nWe also researched other existing indoor solutions a few of them with open-source software like Osiris, Anyplace, Navigine and Google Maps (API).\nWe decided to go with Google Maps since it was already implemented in our university (all rooms were labeled and divided between floors).\nImplementation #For the design of the app we used Figma. and then transferred it to Flutter. This way we created a simple app compatible with a wide variety of operating systems (Web, IOS, Android).\nI was in charge of integrating the Google Maps\u0026rsquo;s and the haptics clues with the cataloged locations.\nSteps of the Navigation Function\nParses the route provided by the Routes API into multiple segments. Determines the user\u0026rsquo;s current segment using real-time location data. Utilizes the phone\u0026rsquo;s compass to ensure the user is heading towards the beginning of the next segment. Transmits sound and vibration feedback to indicate the correct direction. Repeats the above steps continuously until the user reaches the destination. Sneak Peak into our final presentation Outcome #We‚Äôve found that this system‚Äôs performance is markedly superior outdoors than indoors. Even in Android phones where Google uses Wi-Fi positioning indoor the accuracy is rather low and the routes are very limited.\nOverall it was a great experience to learn how to work with Flutter and how to use Google\u0026rsquo;s API\u0026rsquo;s (namely Routes API).\nIn the Demo Day we were given the award for the best Website (link here), honorable mention for the Prototype and decided by the public second Best Overall Product.\nImportant Links # Web App Website Video ","date":"29 June 2024","permalink":"/projects/pic/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"Bachelor's final project"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/directions/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Directions"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/figma/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Figma"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/flutter/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Flutter"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/gitlab/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"GitLab"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/google/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Google"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/indoor/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Indoor"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/maps/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Maps"},{"content":" Crafting Impactful Solutions Together ü§ù It‚Äôs a place to share some of the exciting projects I‚Äôve been apart of.
